in order to start django project you have to create a server first to do that 
go to your cmd or anaconda shell cmd go to path/ folder where you want your server and type command 
django-admin startproject myproject

here django-admin startproject is command and my project refers to your project name 
after that folder is created in that path name as my project and in it certain files are also present 
but our main file is manager.py file 
in order to star server go to cmd , go into your project file and type command 

python manage.py runserver 

this will create your server at your local host / 127.0.0.1:8000

in order to create a app in our django dir type command 
python manage.py startapp myapp

here python manage.py startapp is command and my app refers to name of your app 

for migrations of our main project and our app we use command(this will migrate all your conttent and authentication data 
into your main app)
python manage.py migrate

for any change related to migration type (for example we make changes to our models file) we use command 
python manage.py makemigrations main

here python manage.py makemigrations is command and main is our app name (note:- changes would not apply untill you
re run the command - python manage.py migrate, this will save changes in migration)


python manage.py shell 
this will open cmd shell for your python file

python manage.py createsuperuser
this will create a django administrator account to login first in admin pannel


 {% if user.is_authenticated %}
                    {% block content %}
                    {% endblock %}
                {% else %}
                    <p>to get acces login <a href="/login"> here </a></p>
                {% endif %}

this code will help you to restrict access and authenticate only those who are user or else they need to create account
