two way of sending  info to server is POST method and Get method 
both have its own security benefits 

## for sendding password and modifing database make sure to use post because its encrypted and nnormal user cant able to
 see the info that its sending to server.

## for modifying and getting info of simple stuff or things that dont have much valuable info use get 
this will usually works on html code and not encrypt anything like post method.
